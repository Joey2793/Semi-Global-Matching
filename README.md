# Semi-Global-Matching
<p> Stereo matching is used for finding corresponding pixels in a pair of images. This
project is required to execute Semi-Global Matching Algorithm, which was developed
by Heiko Hirschmueller. By using the Algorithm, the disparity map is constructed by
given two epipolar images.</p>

<p>This algorithm is to find corresponded points, since using epipolar images, the
corresponding points are in the same line, which means they have the same y coordinate.
The disparity d is showed below:<br>
